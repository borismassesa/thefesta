# Curated Venues Icon Updated - COMPLETE

## Summary
Changed the "Curated Venues" icon from castle (🏰) to office building (🏢) to better represent Tanzanian event venues and spaces.

## What Changed

### Before ❌
- **Curated Venues**: `🏰` (castle - inappropriate for Tanzanian context)

### After ✅
- **Curated Venues**: `🏢` (office building - represents modern venues, hotels, event spaces)

## Why This Is Better

### 1. **More Appropriate Context**
- **🏢 Office Building**: Better represents modern Tanzanian venues like hotels, conference centers, and event spaces
- **🏰 Castle**: Too European/medieval, doesn't fit Tanzanian event venue context

### 2. **Better Recognition**
- **🏢**: Instantly recognizable as venues, hotels, event spaces
- **Modern**: Represents contemporary Tanzanian event venues

### 3. **Cultural Relevance**
- **🏢**: Fits Tanzanian urban venues (Dar es Salaam, Arusha, etc.)
- **Practical**: Represents actual types of venues used for events

### 4. **Professional Appearance**
- **🏢**: More professional and business-appropriate
- **Modern**: Aligns with contemporary event planning
